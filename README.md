# README

Create a route tracking app where users can input their home address as well as locations and view their routes via a map. 

Simple postgres DB for backend

The app uses the Openlayers javascript mapping library, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. 

The user can create a route by assigning their home coordinates and destination address
(unfortunately the markers aren't showing yet)

Double click the map to set your destination

the map defaults the home address to where you start
